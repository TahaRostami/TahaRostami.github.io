# Previous Life

I was initiated into the game of chess by one of my cousins at the tender age of nine. At that time, the game was a delightful but unrealistic experience, as there was no differentiation between different pieces. We could even hit the kings! However, my world was shattered a year later when I learned about check and mate from another cousin. I should have intuitively known such rules before, as the real world is governed by laws and rules that favor certain kinds of discrimination. From that moment on, I was hooked. I played with family members and against chess engines whenever I could.

But one question plagued me: why aren't all games drawn, given that both players have the same pieces? I decided to take a chess class to find out. And so began my six-year immersion in the world of chess. I trained for hours each day, became a member of the national team, and won many awards. But I never forgot my burning question.

The answer, it turned out, was simple: players have hidden resources that make all the difference. Background, knowledge, and training methods all play a role. But from a computational perspective, the answer is more fundamental. Still, the chess community isn't interested in solving chess. They just enjoy playing the game.

But I couldn't help wondering: what if two ideal players, with magical powers to make the best move in any given position, faced off against each other? It's a dream, of course. But from my perspective, it's achievable. We could divide our final goal into independent subset goals, and solve the puzzle piece by piece.

As someone with experience in both chess and computation, I'm excited about the possibility of solving this problem. It would be good evidence that even problems with a large number of states can be reduced and solved. And it's personal for me too. I spent countless hours thinking about chess as a teenager. It's a game that's woven into my soul.

But sometimes, we don't realize how much we care about something until it's too late. I'm shouting into the void, hoping that someone will hear me. But for now, the game of kings remains a mystery.
