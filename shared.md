I am self-taught in English and learned by directly reading computer science textbooks. For years, I only focused on reading and did not feel the need to learn other skills, such as writing, speaking, and listening. 

Recently, I realized the importance of these skills when I decided to continue my study abroad. As a result, I now frequently listen to English videos and practice writing and speaking. I have also revisited some of my well-taught experiences and stories and have been sharing them under the pseudonym DearProfessorHunter. I chose this name because I enjoy shows like Mind Hunter and Money Heist and also because adding "Dear" to emails is a common convention when addressing professors.

For now, you can check out my posts in the following link, though someday, I may choose an alternative medium.

I hope you find my writings useful in some way, and I look forward to sharing more in the future.
