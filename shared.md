English is not my native tongue, but I am self-taught in its ways. I spent years immersed in computer science textbooks, honing my comprehension skills. However, I realized the limitations of such a narrow focus when I decided to pursue higher education abroad. In order to fully engage with the world, I knew I needed to improve my abilities in writing, speaking, and listening.

Thus, I embarked on a journey of self-improvement. I challenged myself to listen to English videos on a daily basis, and I made a conscious effort to practice my writing and speaking skills. Along the way, I revisited some of the stories and experiences that had shaped me. Under the pseudonym DearProfessorHunter, I began sharing these personal anecdotes with the world. The name was inspired by my love of shows like Mind Hunter and Money Heist, as well as the academic tradition of addressing one's professors as "Dear."

If you'd like to read some of my musings, for now, you can check out my posts in the following link, though someday, I may choose an alternative medium.

I hope that my writing resonates with you in some way, even if I'm not yet sure how.
