# Notes


I've come to realize that Iran's academic landscape differs significantly from the global norm. As I embarked on my journey to study abroad, I had an eye-opening moment. I understood that my academic background might be perceived quite differently by those unfamiliar with Iran's unique circumstances. In response, I revised my Statement of Purpose (SOP) to provide additional context for those who may find it relevant. This temporary page serves as a platform to offer the necessary background information and adjustments to better understand my academic profile.



**Potential Questions:** The goal here is to provide context and clarity regarding my CV, GitHub, language proficiency, etc. This is achieved by addressing potential questions, such as why I chose journals for my English publications instead of top conferences, which is more common in the CS community. You may find it beneficial to explore a specific section of this manuscript for more detailed information.

**Challenges:** I would like to mention Prof. Mark Dredze's talk, available on YouTube, related to CS PhD Admissions at Johns Hopkins University. He explains their decision-making process, considering 'achievements' and 'opportunities' as key metrics. These metrics assess a candidate's current state and normalize achievements by considering available opportunities. I've detailed the main challenges I faced here, which may be relevant if your institute follows a similar policy. You may be interested in reviewing a specific section of this manuscript.
