# Selected chess games

I was a professional chess player throughout my teens. In the middle of the journey, I decided to focus on my studies and chose computer science as my new passion. So I left professional chess.

Fortunately, I had the chance to play with some of the best chess players in Iran. So I selected some of my games with them. these are some of the games that I'm most fond of, as they have both emotional and professional value to me.
